# Learn-Terraform
Learning Terraform By Doing
general idea:
Terraform -> GitHub -> AWS -> Automated Server Creation Project
Terraform -> GitHub -> AZ -> Automated Server Creation Project
Create a CSV file with parameters
create a terraform script or process that reads the CSV and intakes its listed parameters
Utilize GitHub as a remote repository and practice pulling, pushing, merging, etc
Once the latest and most up to date pull has happened, use Terraform to create an aws instance 
 If successful, test to see how fast you can set up multiple 
Then, see do the same process again but with Azure, taking note of what similatiers or shared code there is
